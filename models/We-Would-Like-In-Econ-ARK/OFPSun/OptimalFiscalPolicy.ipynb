    "### Goal of the paper\n",
    "This paper is designed to study the relationship between the intertemporal behavior of taxes and wealth distribution in a heterogeneous-agent framework. While optimal-taxation problem appears quite often in the literature of representative agent model, it is much less often discussed in a heterogeneous-agent context, one of the reasons of which is that Representative Agent ('RA') model has much stronger welfare implication. However, in Heterogeneous Agent ('HA') model, though, it is quite difficult to argue what is the socially optimal taxation policy without an ad-hoc and somewhat subjective social welfare function, we can still study how the government can manipulate the intertemporal prices to favor some groups over others."

    "###  Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper tries to study the optimal fiscal policy with heterogeneous agents on both of the normative side and positive sides. On the normative side, the Pareto frontier on which there is a trade-off between 'equity and efficiency' is being traced in this paper. In addition, it also also tries to find some postive implications since an ideal political system will select policies close to the Pareto frontier. Particularly when there are large fiscal shocks occuring like a war, the welfare differences among possible fiscal policies will differ a lot, which in turn could make the main argument of the paper more evident."

    "A government that draws its main support from the people who pay taxes should optimally run larger deficits and wait for the end of the war to levy the taxes necessary to repay the defense expenses,vice versa.\n",

    "### Novelty of The Paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a simple model, this paper tries to find a link between the way of financing large public project and the government tendency with efficiency considerations. By doing that, it manages to reveal some features of the optimal distortionary fiscal policy in a 2-agent model. Not a pure theoretical work, it also tries to validate its result based on some emprical evidence. By a simulation of the economies of France and Britain during their war time, it shows that the patterns of fiscal policy implemented by these two governments coincide with those in the history, which thus has also some political implications."
